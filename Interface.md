# Interface
This is a list of areas more specific to front-end developers.
(note that this area is becoming somewhat blurred as service design techniques are introduced into processes)

## UX implementation
* use of prototyping tools
* strong html skills including use of HTML5 best-practices (e.g. NAV, FOOTER tags etc)
* understanding of metadata and tagging for OG, Facebook schemas
* javascript (see separate document)
* service workers
